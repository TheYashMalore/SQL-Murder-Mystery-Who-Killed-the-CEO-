# 🕵️ SQL Murder Mystery — Who Killed the CEO?

A high-stakes SQL investigation where I stepped into the role of a **Lead Data Analyst** to uncover the killer of TechNova Inc.’s CEO.  
Using SQL, I pieced together evidence from multiple datasets — keycard logs, phone records, alibi statements, and movement trails — to solve the case.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project is the **final capstone** of the *IDC 21-Day SQL Challenge*, designed to test real-world analytical thinking and database investigation skills.

I worked through multiple datasets to:

- Identify the exact **time & location** of the crime  
- Analyze **keycard access patterns**  
- Validate or break **alibis**  
- Investigate **suspicious phone activity**  
- Correlate **timestamps and movements**  
- Combine insights to pinpoint the killer

## 🧠 Investigation Steps

1. Determine crime time & location  
2. Analyze keycard entries  
3. Cross-check all alibis  
4. Trace phone call activity  
5. Validate movement timelines  
6. Combine evidence & identify inconsistencies  

---

## 📌 Key Findings

- The murder occurred in the **CEO’s office around 9 PM**
- **David Kumar** accessed the office during that exact window
- His alibi did **not match** the electronic movement logs
- He made **two suspicious calls** near the crime time
- Evidence contradicted his claimed location  
- All clues point to him being the **prime suspect**

---

## 🧩 Final Conclusion

After a complete SQL-based forensic analysis, the murderer was identified as **David Kumar**, based on contradictory alibis, keycard logs, movement traces, and phone activity.
