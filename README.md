# 🕵️ SQL Murder Mystery — Who Killed the CEO?

A high-stakes SQL investigation where I stepped into the role of a **Lead Data Analyst** to uncover the killer of TechNova Inc.’s CEO.  
Using SQL, I pieced together evidence from multiple datasets — keycard logs, phone records, alibi statements, and movement trails — to solve the case.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project is the **final capstone** of the *IDC 21-Day SQL Challenge*, designed to test real-world analytical thinking and database investigation skills.

I worked through multiple datasets to:

- Identify the exact **time & location** of the crime  
- Analyze **keycard access patterns**  
- Validate or break **alibis**  
- Investigate **suspicious phone activity**  
- Correlate **timestamps and movements**  
- Combine insights to pinpoint the killer
